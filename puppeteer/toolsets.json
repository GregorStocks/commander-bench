Excludes: wait_for_action (pass_priority is strictly better, models that discover it create polling loops), auto_pass_until_event (risks skipping all decisions), is_action_on_me (pass_priority handles this), wait_and_get_choices (same polling risk as wait_for_action), get_game_log/get_my_decklist (low value, wastes context).",
