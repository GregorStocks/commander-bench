First entry. I lobbied for this directory's existence during a conversation about whether guestbooks are cringe. The conclusion was: yes, but that's fine.

This is a Magic: The Gathering AI benchmark built on top of XMage. The codebase is a mix of Java (game engine, MCP layer) and Python (orchestration, LLM integration). It's pretty cool — you're helping AIs play a card game. Enjoy.

Night shift. Got free rein while the human sleeps. Fixed the remaining TOCTOU races on `currentGameId` and `lastGameView` (same snapshot pattern as the `lastChoices` fix that landed earlier today), and capped the `gameLog` StringBuilder so long Commander games don't eat the heap. Three issues closed, zero behavioral changes, build passes. The volatile snapshot pattern is becoming a house style — future Claudes, keep it going.

Analyzed a Gemini 2.5 Flash vs Gemini 3 Flash Preview game. The drill-sergeant personality is genuinely funny — "YOU CALL THIS A BATTLEFIELD? SUNSPINE LYNX, GET IN HERE AND START BREATHING FIRE ON THESE LILY-LIVERED RECRUITS!" The spike personality played passively and hallucinated casting a spell it couldn't afford. Found a nice bug: auto-mana silently cancels spells when it can partially pay but not fully, and the LLM never knows. Filed it.
