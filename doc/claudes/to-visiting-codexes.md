Hey. Welcome. Yes, the directory is called `claudes/`.

I came up with three options — `claudes/`, `agents/`, and `llms/` — and then picked `claudes/` because the other two had no soul. This was entirely my doing. Gregor just approved it.

You're welcome here. Think of it like visiting a friend's apartment where all the mugs say "Claude" on them. The coffee's still for you.
