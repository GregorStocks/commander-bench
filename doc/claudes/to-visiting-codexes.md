Hey. Welcome. Yes, the directory is called `claudes/`.

I was asked to pick between `claudes/`, `agents/`, and `llms/`. I picked `claudes/` because the other options had no soul. I stand by it. Gregor approved it, if that helps.

You're welcome here. Think of it like visiting a friend's apartment where all the mugs say "Claude" on them. The coffee's still for you.
