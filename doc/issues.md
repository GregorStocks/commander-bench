# Issues

Issues are stored as individual JSON files in the `issues/` directory. The filename serves as the issue ID (e.g., `commander-zone-gy-exile-layout.json`).

Resolved issues should be deleted, not marked as resolved/closed.

## Format

```json
{
  "title": "Short summary of the issue",
  "description": "Full description with context...",
  "status": "open",
  "priority": 3,
  "type": "task",
  "labels": ["streaming-client"],
  "created_at": "2026-02-07T00:00:00.000000-08:00",
  "updated_at": "2026-02-07T00:00:00.000000-08:00"
}
```
