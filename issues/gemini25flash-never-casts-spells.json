  "description": "Gemini 2.5 Flash plays lands but never casts any spells throughout the entire game, despite having mana available and castable cards in hand. The model consistently passes priority even when it has playable options.\n\nEvidence from game_20260209_184021: Gemini 2.5 Flash (Player 2) played multiple lands but cast zero spells across the entire game. get_action_choices showed playable cards but the model always chose to pass.\n\nThis may be a prompt/instruction issue \u2014 the model might not understand when or how to cast spells, or it might be overly conservative about spending mana.\n\nGame log: ~/mage-bench-logs/game_20260209_184021/",
