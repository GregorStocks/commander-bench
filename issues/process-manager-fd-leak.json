  "title": "File descriptor leak when spawning processes with log files",
  "description": "process_manager.py:102 opens a file with `open(log_file, \"w\")` and passes the file object as `stdout` to `subprocess.Popen`, but the file handle is never stored or closed. Popen does not close file descriptors passed to it - that's the caller's responsibility.\n\nOver multiple game runs or when spawning many headless clients, this leaks file descriptors. The handle should be stored and closed in `cleanup()`, or the code should use a context manager pattern.",
