  "description": "In game_20260214_115320_g2 (Gem25F Johnny, gemini-2.5-flash), the model got stuck in a loop where it called pass_priority() but immediately got back stop_reason: playable_cards, actions_passed: 0 — priority never actually passed because the GAME_SELECT had castable spells (Fury, Chalice).\n\nThe model thought Ancient Tomb (p9) was in hand and wanted to play it as a land, but p9 was actually in the graveyard. So it kept calling pass_priority hoping to get a land-play prompt, but pass_priority kept bouncing back because of the castable spells.\n\nThe correct action was choose_action(answer=false) to explicitly decline the spells, which the model did use a couple times (seq 113, 122) and it worked. But it kept falling back to pass_priority instead.\n\nThis is by-design behavior in pass_priority (it auto-stops for playable cards so the LLM can decide), but it creates a trap when the model is confused about game state. Combined with max_tokens=512 causing finish_reason=length on the reasoning, this created a 4-minute stall.\n\nConsider: should pass_priority have a force/skip parameter? Or should the system prompt more clearly explain that pass_priority won't advance past playable cards?",
