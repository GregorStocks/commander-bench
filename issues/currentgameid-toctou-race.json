  "title": "TOCTOU race on volatile currentGameId in SkeletonCallbackHandler",
  "description": "SkeletonCallbackHandler.java has a volatile UUID field `currentGameId` (line 87) with 4 compound check-then-use patterns:\n\n- Line 188: `UUID myPlayerId = currentGameId != null ? activeGames.get(currentGameId) : null;`\n- Line 449: same pattern\n- Line 1086: same pattern\n- Line 1493: same pattern\n\nBetween the null check and the `activeGames.get()` call, another thread could set `currentGameId` to null, causing a NullPointerException or returning the wrong player ID.\n\nFix: snapshot `currentGameId` into a local variable before each compound operation, same pattern as the lastChoices fix.",
