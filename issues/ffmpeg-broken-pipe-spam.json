  "description": "FFmpegEncoder.consumeFrame() (line 72-83) catches IOException on write failure but continues accepting subsequent frames. When FFmpeg is killed (e.g., game process receives SIGHUP), every remaining frame triggers another failed write and another logged error.\n\nEvidence:\n- ~/mage-bench-logs/game_20260210_224830/spectator.log: \"Failed to write frame 24648\" with java.io.IOException: Broken pipe, followed by \"FFmpeg exited with code: 129\"\n\nSource: FFmpegEncoder.java:80-82 — stdin.write() throws IOException, caught and logged, but no flag prevents future writes\n\nSuggested fix: Add a volatile boolean pipeBroken field. Set it to true on first IOException in consumeFrame(). Short-circuit future writes when the flag is set.",
