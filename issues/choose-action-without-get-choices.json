  "description": "Multiple models call choose_action with an index without first calling get_action_choices to see the available options. This causes 33 index-out-of-range errors across the game because the lastChoices list is stale or empty.\n\nEvidence from game_20260209_184021: 33 index out of range errors logged across multiple players. Models appear to guess indices from previous turns or assume choices haven't changed.\n\nPossible fixes:\n- Return a clearer error message when index is out of range, telling the model to call get_action_choices first\n- Auto-call get_action_choices internally when choose_action is called with stale choices\n- Add validation that rejects choose_action if get_action_choices hasn't been called since the last state change",
