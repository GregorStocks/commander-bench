  "title": "Models don't understand mandatory vs optional target selections",
  "description": "When XMage requires a mandatory target selection (e.g. for a spell on the stack), models try to pass priority or send answer:false instead of selecting a target. They don't understand that some selections are required and cannot be skipped.\n\nEvidence from game_20260209_184021: Models repeatedly try to skip mandatory GAME_TARGET prompts, causing the prompt to reappear and creating loops.\n\nPossible fixes:\n- Include a 'required' flag in get_action_choices output when the selection is mandatory\n- Add clearer messaging in the MCP layer about mandatory vs optional selections\n- Auto-select the only valid target when there's exactly one legal option\n\nGame log: ~/mage-bench-logs/game_20260209_184021/",
