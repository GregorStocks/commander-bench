  "title": "No game-over event recorded when time limit hit",
  "description": "When the game ends due to the time limit, no GAME_OVER event is recorded in game_events.jsonl. The game just stops without a proper termination event, making it harder to analyze game outcomes.\n\nEvidence from game_20260209_184021: Game ended at time limit but game_events.jsonl has no game-over or end-game event. The log just stops.\n\nPossible fixes:\n- Ensure the harness writes a game-over event when the time limit triggers\n- Capture the final game state (life totals, board state) at termination\n- Record which player was winning at the time of termination\n\nGame log: ~/mage-bench-logs/game_20260209_184021/",
