  "title": "Leaderboard table columns truncated on mobile viewports",
  "description": "On narrow viewports (~375px), the leaderboard table's rightmost column ('Avg API Cost') is clipped — the header shows as 'Avg AP' and cost values are cut off or invisible. The table doesn't scroll horizontally either, so there's no way to see the full data. Options: make the table horizontally scrollable in a container, hide less important columns on mobile, or abbreviate headers (e.g. 'Cost' instead of 'Avg API Cost').",
