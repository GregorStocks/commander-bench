  "title": "Show card images on battlefield instead of text pills",
  "description": "The visualizer currently shows cards as small text pills (card-chips). The battlefield zone should show actual card images from Scryfall instead — small thumbnails arranged in a grid, with tapped cards rotated 90 degrees. The card image URLs are already in the exported JSON's cardImages map. Hand/graveyard/exile can stay as text pills since they're secondary zones.",
