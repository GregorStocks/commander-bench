  "description": "pilot.py:338-343 (LLM degraded), pilot.py:399-404 (credits exhausted / model not found), and chatterbox.py:226-231 (credits exhausted) all enter `while True` loops calling `auto_pass_until_event` with no exit condition.\n\nIf the MCP connection dies or the tool keeps raising exceptions, these loops spin forever with 5-second sleeps. The game hangs indefinitely and the harness must be forcibly killed.\n\nShould have a max retry count, detect game-over state, or break out after a timeout.",
