  "description": "Gemini 2.5 Flash returned a completely empty response from the LLM API on its very first turn, causing a wasted action cycle. The harness had to retry.\n\nEvidence from game_20260209_184021: Empty response logged from Gemini 2.5 Flash at the start of the game.\n\nThis may be a transient API issue, but the harness should handle empty responses gracefully \u2014 either retry automatically or pass priority rather than wasting a full action cycle.\n\nGame log: ~/mage-bench-logs/game_20260209_184021/",
