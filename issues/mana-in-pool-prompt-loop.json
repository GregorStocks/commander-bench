  "title": "Mana-in-pool prompt traps LLMs in 20+ iteration loops",
  "description": "When a player has unspent mana in their pool, XMage sends repeated GAME_ASK prompts asking if they want to use it. LLMs don't understand how to dismiss this and get trapped in loops of 20+ iterations trying to pass priority or take other actions while the mana prompt keeps reappearing.\n\nEvidence from game_20260209_184021: Multiple players hit this, especially after tapping lands without successfully casting a spell. The loop burns through context and wastes turns.\n\nPossible fixes:\n- Auto-answer 'no' to mana-in-pool prompts in the MCP layer after a configurable number of asks\n- Detect the mana-in-pool pattern and provide clearer guidance to the LLM\n- Add a special case in passPriority() or handleCallback() to auto-dismiss\n\nGame log: ~/mage-bench-logs/game_20260209_184021/",
