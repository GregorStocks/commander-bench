  "description": "The 'Watch' link in the site nav points to an external YouTube playlist URL, but it renders as a plain <a> tag without target=\"_blank\". Clicking it navigates the current tab away from the site. It should open in a new tab and ideally have a visual indicator that it's an external link (e.g. an icon or subtle styling). See website/src/layouts/Base.astro line 16.",
