  "description": "cleanup_orphans.py:3 imports `cleanup_orphans` from `puppeteer.process_manager`, but that function doesn't exist in process_manager.py. The module only exports `kill_tree()` and the `ProcessManager` class. Running the cleanup script crashes immediately with ImportError.\n\nThis means orphan processes from crashed games are never cleaned up by the script.",
