  "description": "Show a small sparkline or line graph at the top of the visualizer tracking each player's life total over the course of the game. As the user steps through snapshots, a vertical marker moves along the graph showing the current position. This gives an immediate sense of how the game went (who was ahead, when someone got knocked out, etc.).",
