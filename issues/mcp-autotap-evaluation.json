  "title": "Evaluate LLM mana tapping accuracy vs token cost",
  "description": "Now that explicit mana sourcing is available via mana_plan, we need to evaluate how well various models handle manual tapping.\n\nTasks:\n- Analyze game logs to measure how often mana_plan entries fail (ID not available, wrong type)\n- Compare token cost of mana_plan usage vs auto_tap for different spell complexities\n- Track how often GAME_CHOOSE_ABILITY deferrals happen (multi-ability lands) and whether models handle them correctly\n- If models get lots of failures, consider creating an auto-tap-only MCP tool they can use as a simpler alternative\n- Determine if certain model families (e.g. smaller models) should default to auto_tap while larger models benefit from mana_plan",
