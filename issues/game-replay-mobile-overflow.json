  "title": "Game replay controls and layout overflow on mobile",
  "description": "On mobile viewports (~375px), the game replay page has several overflow issues:\n\n1. The playback scrubber/progress bar extends beyond the viewport — the slider and frame counter (e.g. '68 / 132') are clipped off the right edge.\n2. The player header line (name, model ID, cost, Elo, life, library) wraps awkwardly with pieces like 'Life 20 | Lib 49' breaking across lines.\n3. A horizontal scrollbar appears at the bottom of the page.\n\nThe game log panel correctly moves below the game board on mobile, but the controls bar needs responsive treatment — possibly stacking the scrubber below the buttons, or making the frame counter smaller.",
