  "title": "Add batch oracle helper for visible in-game objects",
  "description": "get_oracle_text supports single lookups and name batches, but common gameplay flows need oracle text for many visible objects at once (stack + battlefield threats). Repeated single calls add round trips and token overhead.\n\nProposed direction:\n1. Add object-id batch support to get_oracle_text (object_ids array), or a dedicated get_visible_oracle_text tool.\n2. Return per-object results with stable identifiers and per-entry errors.\n3. Clearly define behavior for tokens, face-down cards, and unknown object IDs.\n\nDesign questions:\n- Prefer extending existing tool vs adding new tool?\n- Should default scope include only visible cards, or all known objects in state?\n\nSuggested source area: Mage.Client.Headless/src/main/java/mage/client/headless/BridgeCallbackHandler.java:getOracleText and McpServer schema.",
