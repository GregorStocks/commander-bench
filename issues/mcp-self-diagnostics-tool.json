  "title": "Add MCP self-diagnostics tool for bridge health and loop telemetry",
  "description": "Debugging stalls and choice mismatches currently requires correlating multiple logs. A lightweight MCP diagnostics tool would expose internal bridge telemetry directly for faster triage.\n\nProposed fields:\n- pending_action_age_ms\n- current_action_type\n- interactions_this_turn\n- last_response_retry_count / last_response_age_ms\n- recent_choose_action_error_counts by category\n- game_log_buffer_usage and trimmed_chars\n\nGoals:\n1. Reduce time-to-diagnosis for multiplayer desync and loop cases.\n2. Provide structured evidence for automated issue triage scripts.\n3. Keep output compact so it is safe for frequent polling.\n\nSuggested source area: Mage.Client.Headless/src/main/java/mage/client/headless/BridgeCallbackHandler.java and Mage.Client.Headless/src/main/java/mage/client/headless/McpServer.java tool list.",
