  "description": "GPT-4.1-mini used Sultai Charm's destroy mode to kill its own creature instead of an opponent's. This indicates the model doesn't properly evaluate targets or understand the strategic implications of its choices.\n\nEvidence from game_20260209_184021: GPT-4.1-mini cast Sultai Charm and targeted its own creature for destruction.\n\nThis is likely a model reasoning issue rather than a tooling bug, but better target context in get_action_choices (e.g. labeling which player controls each target) might help prevent this.\n\nGame log: ~/mage-bench-logs/game_20260209_184021/",
