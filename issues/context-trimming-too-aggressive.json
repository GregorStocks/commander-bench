  "description": "All players hit the 122-message context limit repeatedly, triggering 28 total context trims across the game. This means models are losing important game history and earlier strategic context.\n\nEvidence from game_20260209_184021: 28 context trim events. Every player hit the limit multiple times, suggesting the message budget is too tight or messages are too verbose.\n\nPossible fixes:\n- Reduce verbosity of game state updates to fit more turns in context\n- Increase the message limit if model context windows allow it\n- Implement smarter trimming that preserves key game events (spells cast, combat results) while dropping routine passes\n- Compress older game state into a summary message instead of keeping individual messages\n\nGame log: ~/mage-bench-logs/game_20260209_184021/",
