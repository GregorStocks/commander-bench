  "title": "GameLogWriter doesn't support context manager protocol",
  "description": "In puppeteer/src/puppeteer/game_log.py, GameLogWriter.__init__ opens a file handle (line 19) but the class doesn't implement __enter__/__exit__. If an exception occurs before .close() is called, the file handle leaks. The class is used in the harness where exceptions during gameplay are common. Should implement __enter__/__exit__ so callers can use it as a context manager.",
