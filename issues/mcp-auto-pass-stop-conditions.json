  "title": "Smarter auto-passing with bluff support",
  "description": "pass_priority currently auto-passes whenever there are no playable cards. This is efficient but prevents bluffing (holding priority to represent a trick). We deleted auto_pass_until_event, wait_for_action, and is_action_on_me as redundant/dangerous tools, but the underlying need remains: smarter priority management.\n\nProposed direction:\n- Add a bluff mode to pass_priority where the LLM can opt to hold priority for a configurable duration even when there's nothing to play, to represent interaction.\n- Consider stop conditions: stop_on_combat, stop_on_stack_nonempty, stop_on_life_change, etc. so the LLM can be more selective about when it wants control back.\n- Return which stop condition fired (stop_reason) for deterministic client handling.\n\nDesign questions:\n1. Which stop conditions are reliably detectable from existing callback/game state surfaces?\n2. How should bluff timing work — fixed delay, or until opponent acts?\n3. How should this interact with timeout semantics?\n\nSuggested source area: Mage.Client.Headless/src/main/java/mage/client/headless/BridgeCallbackHandler.java:passPriority and McpServer tool schema.",
