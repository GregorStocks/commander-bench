  "description": "SkeletonCallbackHandler.java:91 declares `failedManaCasts` as a plain `HashSet<UUID>`. It is read/iterated from MCP tool handler threads (getActionChoices at lines 519, 529) and written/cleared from XMage callback threads (lines 1173+, 519-520). This can throw ConcurrentModificationException or silently corrupt the set.\n\nShould be replaced with `ConcurrentHashMap.newKeySet()` or wrapped with `Collections.synchronizedSet()`.",
