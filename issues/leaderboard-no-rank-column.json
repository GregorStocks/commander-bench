  "description": "The leaderboard table shows Model Name, Provider, Rating, Games Played, and Avg API Cost, but doesn't display the rank position (#1, #2, #3, etc.). Adding a rank column as the first column would make it easier to see at a glance where a model stands, especially after scrolling past the top entries or when using search/filter. The rank should update based on the current sort order and format filter.",
