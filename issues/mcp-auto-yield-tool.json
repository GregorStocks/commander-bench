  "description": "Many priority passes during opponents' turns are obvious and waste a full LLM inference each. The LLM currently gets woken up for every priority stop even when it has no instant-speed interaction available.\n\nPossible approaches (need to evaluate feasibility):\n\n1. set_priority_mode(mode) - adjust pass_priority behavior:\n   - 'aggressive': auto-pass on opponents' turns unless you have instant-speed spells/abilities in hand\n   - 'defensive': stop on every priority (current behavior)\n   - 'normal': auto-pass when no instant-speed interaction available\n   This is the simplest. The Java MCP layer already knows what's in your hand.\n\n2. Explicit auto-response rules like set_auto_response('rhystic_study_tax', 'always_pay'). Very powerful but hard to implement - triggers need to map to specific XMage action types, and the space of possible triggers is huge.\n\n3. 'auto-pass until my next turn' as a single tool call. Simple but loses all ability to respond to opponents. Basically auto_pass_until_event scoped to your next upkeep.\n\nDesign work needed:\n1. Analyze game logs to quantify how many priority passes happen per turn cycle and how many are meaningful\n2. Evaluate which approach is feasible given XMage's action model (can pass_priority already detect instant-speed interaction?)\n3. Consider interaction with pass_priority's existing has_playable_cards field\n4. Token savings estimate: if approach #1 eliminates 80% of opponent-turn wakeups, how many tokens does that save per game?",
