  "title": "yield_until: support yielding until a specific PhaseStep",
  "description": "The current yield_until implementation supports XMage's built-in yield actions (end_of_turn, next_turn, next_main, etc.). A future enhancement could allow yielding until a specific PhaseStep (e.g. 'yield until opponent's declare_attackers step') for more precise control.\n\nThis would require either:\n1. A custom yield mechanism in BridgeCallbackHandler that checks the current step on each callback\n2. Extending XMage's PlayerAction enum with step-specific yields (upstream change)\n\nApproach #1 is more feasible since it doesn't require upstream changes.",
