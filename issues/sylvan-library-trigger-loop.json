  "description": "GPT-4.1-mini gets stuck in an infinite loop when Sylvan Library's triggered ability fires. The model repeatedly tries to interact with the trigger but fails to resolve it, burning through its entire context window.\n\nEvidence from game_20260209_184021: The Sylvan Library trigger caused a sustained loop that consumed most of GPT-4.1-mini's remaining context budget.\n\nThis may be related to the answer:false issue (gpt4mini-answer-false-cancels-targets) — the model may be cancelling its own trigger resolution. Could also be a GAME_SELECT or GAME_ASK prompt that the model doesn't know how to navigate.",
