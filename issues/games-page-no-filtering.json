  "description": "The Games page lists all past games in reverse chronological order, but provides no way to filter or search them. As the number of games grows, it will become difficult to find specific matchups. Useful filters would include:\n\n- Format (Standard, Modern, Legacy, Commander) — similar to the leaderboard format tabs\n- Model/player name search\n- Winner filter\n\nThe leaderboard's 'Games Played' links are green and appear clickable, suggesting they might link to filtered game lists, but the games page itself has no filter controls.",
