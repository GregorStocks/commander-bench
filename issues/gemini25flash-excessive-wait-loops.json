  "title": "Gemini 2.5 Flash excessive wait_for_action loops when not its turn",
  "description": "Gemini 2.5 Flash calls wait_for_action in rapid succession when it's not the active player, creating long loops of polling calls. This burns through context and API tokens without accomplishing anything.\n\nEvidence from game_20260209_184021: Extended sequences of wait_for_action calls from Gemini 2.5 Flash during other players' turns.\n\nPossible fixes:\n- Add backoff/delay guidance in the system prompt\n- Implement server-side rate limiting on wait_for_action\n- Have the MCP layer batch wait results to reduce round-trips\n\nGame log: ~/mage-bench-logs/game_20260209_184021/",
