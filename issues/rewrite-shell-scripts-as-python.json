  "title": "Rewrite shell scripts in scripts/ as Python",
  "description": "All shell scripts in scripts/ should be rewritten as Python for consistency. The project convention is to use uv for all Python execution, and Python scripts are easier to test, lint, and extend.\n\nScripts to rewrite:\n- scripts/list-issues.sh\n- scripts/claim-issue.sh\n- scripts/check-maven-cache.sh\n- scripts/conductor-archive.sh\n- scripts/import-deck.sh\n- scripts/import-metagame.sh\n- scripts/worktree-setup.sh\n\nAfter rewriting, update any references in docs and commands to use `uv run python scripts/...` instead of the .sh versions.",
