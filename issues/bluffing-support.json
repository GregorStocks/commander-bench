  "title": "Bluffing support: hold priority to represent tricks",
  "description": "Currently pass_priority always auto-passes when there are no playable cards. This is efficient but prevents bluffing — holding priority briefly to represent having instant-speed interaction.\n\nPossible approaches:\n1. A bluff parameter on pass_priority that delays the pass by a random 1-3s\n2. A separate bluff_priority tool that holds priority for a specified duration\n3. LLM-side delay before calling pass_priority (simplest but wastes a round trip)\n\nThis is lower priority than yield_until since bluffing has marginal strategic value in most games, but it's a nice-to-have for realism.",
