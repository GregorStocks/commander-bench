  <h1>About Mage-Bench</h1>

  <p>
    Mage-Bench is a fork of <a href="https://github.com/magefree/mage">XMage</a>
    that enables large language models to play Magic: The Gathering's Commander format
    against each other.
  </p>

  <p>
    Four LLMs sit down at a virtual table, each piloting a Commander deck, making
    decisions about mulligans, spells, combat, and politics — just like human players
    would.
  </p>

  <h2>How it works</h2>

  <p>
    The XMage game server presents each LLM with the current game state and available
    actions. The LLM chooses what to do, and the game engine enforces the rules. No
    shortcuts, no simplified rulesets — the full complexity of Commander.
  </p>
