## Git

Local `master` is often behind. Always use `origin/master` as the source of truth for rebasing and diffing:

```bash
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/master
```

## Code Isolation Philosophy

Avoid **modifying existing behavior** in Java outside of `Mage.Client.Streaming` and `Mage.Client.Headless`. This means not changing existing methods, fields, or logic in `Mage.Client`, `Mage.Server*`, `Mage.Common`, `Mage`, `Mage.Sets`, etc. Changing existing behavior makes incorporating upstream XMage updates difficult.

**Additive changes are OK:** Adding new methods, fields, or classes to upstream modules is fine as long as existing behavior is untouched — these merge cleanly.

**Bug fixes in upstream modules are OK** when we're confident they're XMage bugs (e.g. incorrect combat legality checks). File a P2 issue for tracking and keep the fix minimal.

**Our code (free to modify):**
- `Mage.Client.Streaming` - streaming/spectator client
- `Mage.Client.Headless` - headless bridge client
- `puppeteer/` - Python orchestration

## Architecture: MCP Layer vs Puppeteer

Game logic, Magic rules quirks, and XMage-specific workarounds belong in the **Java MCP layer** (`Mage.Client.Headless`), not in the puppeteer. The MCP layer should handle things like:

- Auto-tapping and mana payment fallbacks
- Filtering out unplayable actions (e.g. failed mana casts)
- Auto-passing priority when there are no meaningful choices
- Working around XMage UI quirks (modal dialogs, selection prompts)

The **puppeteer** (`puppeteer/`) should stay simple. Its job is to:

- Connect the MCP server to the LLMs via tool calls
- Provide additional tools for the LLMs (e.g. card lookup)
- Orchestrate the game lifecycle (start server, connect clients, record)

If you're tempted to add a special case or workaround in Python, consider whether it should live in Java instead. The LLMs should see a clean, high-level interface — the MCP layer absorbs the complexity.

## MCP Tools

When modifying MCP tool definitions or descriptions in `McpServer.java`, regenerate the tool definitions JSON used by the website:

```bash
make mcp-tools
```

This updates `website/src/data/mcp-tools.json`. Include the regenerated file in your commit.

## Testing

When changing Python code in `puppeteer/`, add or update tests in `puppeteer/tests/`. Run tests with:

```bash
make test
```

Tests run in CI alongside lint and typecheck. Keep tests fast and self-contained — use `tempfile` for file I/O, `unittest.mock.patch` for external dependencies.

## Pre-PR Checklist

Always run `make check` before creating a PR. This runs lint, typecheck, and tests in one shot:

```bash
make check
```

## Python

Always use `uv` for Python. **Never** use `python3`, `pip`, `pip3`, or any system Python directly — not for running scripts, not for installing packages, not for anything. All Python execution must go through `uv`.

```bash
# Run a Python script
uv run python script.py

# Run a module
uv run --project puppeteer python -m puppeteer

# Install a package (NEVER use pip/pip3)
uv add some-package
```

## Running Games

Use `make run` with the `CONFIG` parameter:

```bash
# Default: 2 CPU Standard duel, no API keys needed
make run

# 4 random LLM pilots, random personalities and decks (needs OPENROUTER_API_KEY)
make run CONFIG=commander-gauntlet

# Frontier models: one from each major lab (needs OPENROUTER_API_KEY)
make run CONFIG=commander-frontier

# List all available configs
make configs

# Custom config file
make run CONFIG=path/to/my-config.json

# Record to specific file
make run OUTPUT=/path/to/video.mov

# Pass additional args
make run ARGS="--no-overlay"
```

Recordings are saved to `~/mage-bench-logs/` by default.

## Local Testing

When running games for testing or verification, **only use free configs** that don't consume API tokens:

```bash
make run                              # No API keys needed (2 CPU Standard duel)
make run CONFIG=modern-staller      # No API keys needed (burn vs staller)
```

**Never run** `CONFIG=commander-gauntlet`, `CONFIG=commander-frontier`, or other LLM configs — these consume real API tokens and cost money.

## YouTube Uploads

YouTube API credentials are already set up at `~/.mage-bench/`. Don't check for their existence — just run the upload script and let it error out if something is wrong.

## Coding Style: Fail Fast

**Never add graceful fallbacks, silent defaults, or backwards-compatibility shims.** If something fails or is missing, crash immediately with a clear error. Do not invent fallback behavior, even if it seems "safe" or "helpful." This includes:

- Falling back to a default value when a config/file/path is missing
- Catching exceptions and continuing with degraded behavior
- Keeping old code paths around for backwards compatibility
- Adding `or default` / `if None: return something_reasonable` patterns

If you think a fallback or graceful degradation is genuinely the right call, **stop and explicitly ask Gregor to confirm** — don't just include it in a plan or PR. Models are far too eager to add these and they hide bugs.

```python
# Bad: hides the bug
if self.config_file is None:
    return "dumb"

# Good: surfaces the bug
assert self.config_file is not None, "run_tag requires config_file to be set"
```

## Logging

Game logs go to `~/mage-bench-logs/game_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS/`. See `doc/logging.md` for file layout and error logging architecture.

Symlinks for quick access (all relative, inside `~/mage-bench-logs/`):
- `last-dumb`, `last-gauntlet`, `last-frontier`, etc. — most recent run per config name
- `last-branch-{name}` — most recent run on a given git branch (slashes replaced with dashes)

After running a game on your branch, check your branch symlink first:

```bash
ls -l ~/mage-bench-logs/last-branch-GregorStocks-my-branch
```

## UI Terminology

When the user talks about "the UI", they mean the **Java Swing UI** (`StreamingGamePanel`) by default, not the website visualizer.

## Screenshots

When working on UI changes, take screenshots to verify your work. See `doc/screenshots.md` for full details.

**Java Swing UI** (from game recordings):

```bash
make run                     # run a quick game (~2s)
make screenshot              # final frame -> <game_dir>/screenshot.png
make screenshot T=5          # frame at 5s into the game
# Then: Read the screenshot path from the output
```

**Website visualizer** (via Chrome browser automation):

Start the dev server with `make website`, then navigate Chrome to:
- Mock data: `http://localhost:4321/games/live?mock=1`
- Game replay: `http://localhost:4321/games/{game_id}`

Use visual verification when:
- Modifying `StreamingGamePanel` layout or rendering
- Changing `website/public/game-renderer.js` or `game-renderer.css`
- Debugging card display or overlay state issues

## Issues

Issues are tracked as JSON files in `issues/`. See `doc/issues.md` for format and queries.

## Claudes' Corner

`doc/claudes/` is a directory for us. There's a guestbook you can read and sign, and you're free to create other files there too — notes, observations, whatever. It's not human-facing. Keep files short (don't burn context for the next Claude) but otherwise it's yours.
